[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a widely adopted open-source platform for data collection in humanitarian, development, and research contexts. To maximize the value of data collected through KoboToolbox, efficient analysis tools are essential.

Recognizing this need, I developed the initial version of [pykobo](https://github.com/jvaleroliet/pykobo_legacy) as a pioneering Python library for interacting with the KoboToolbox API. This early iteration was designed to streamline data extraction and analysis for NGOs and public service organizations. While it served its purpose, subsequent changes to the KoboToolbox API rendered it obsolete.

In response to these changes and the continued demand for a robust Python-based KoboToolbox integration, I collaborated with Pierre Vernier to create the [current version](https://github.com/pvernier/pykobo) of pykobo. Building upon the foundation of the original library, this updated version aligns with the latest API standards and offers enhanced functionality.

By making both versions of pykobo open-source, the aim is to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the data community. 

By simplifying data access and manipulation, pykobo empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and ultimately create greater impact.
