## BIP Spain

After my 6 months intership at ["Action Against Hunger"](/ach), I started my professional career in the IT industry.

**BIP** is an Italian multinational consulting company that works for businesses and public administration. Operating at the intersection of business and technology BIP design, develop, and deliver sustainable solutions at pace and scale creating greater value for your customers, employees, shareholders and society. 

My position was **Data Science Specialist at xTech**, the technology unit of BIP Spain that provides data-driven solutions to clients.

In the six months of my stay, I worked immersed in the prediction and analysis of the maintenance of the devices of an Italian POS firm. I learned the basics of **machine learning** and developed a **dashboard** to analyze the data of the company.

Although it was interesting, I got the chance to return to [Action Against Hunger](/ach) and decided to **take on the challenge**.
