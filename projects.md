Here are some of my free-time projects:

* [deepdiggin](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) <i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i> a python application based on deep learning to classify vinyl records according to the Goldmine Grading, from an audio clip (wip).

* [my spotify data](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) <i class="fa fa-music"></i> an analysis of my lifetime streaming history on spotify (14 years!).

* [pykobo](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) <i class="fa fa-code"> a python library to read and write data from/to KoboToolBox.
