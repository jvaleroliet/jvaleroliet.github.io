title: Action Against Hunger
---
I've been working in **Action Against Hunger** for the past 3 years. From doing an intership to **establish the first Data Analysis Unit** in Spain, it has been an amazing and challenging experience.
We can divide this journey in three main stages:

### 1. Intership (2021)

Just after finishing my **Pure and Applied Mathematics Degree**, I started my first job as a **Data Science Intern** in the Business Analytics Department of the HQ. Here I learned how to program in **Python** and **R**, how to use **SQL** and how to develop dashbaords in **Power BI**. 

I also had the opportunity to work with an international Data Science Team in the field of Social Impact. I was able to learn how to use the tools and techniques of Data Science to solve real-world problems and to make a difference in the lives of beneficiaries of the programs.

We developed an **Early Warning System** dashboard to evaluate the situation of every country in the world, including indicators of their markets, economy, environment, public health, gender inequality, armed conflicts and human mobility, to be able to deploy the Emergency Pool earlier in case of a crisis.

My main responsability was to develop the **automatic extraction** in R of 61 indicators from 20 different sources, through the use of JSON API, R libraries, SLXS, HTML scrapping, and satellite data extraction, processing and mapping using GIS techniques in R.

### 2. Data Analyst in Spain Mission (2022)

After 6 months working in [BIP Spain](/bip), I was invited to join Spain Mission as a **Data Analyst**. In Spain Mission there was no Data Department at the moment, and this position was placed under the Quality Department. 

The previous employee started building the database (doing an amazing job!) for the programs and the beneficiaries and building Power BI dashboards to monitore the projects, but all the processes were still manual. So I saw the great **opportunity to automate** the processes and improve the efficiency of the team. My main tasks included:

- Development of Python-based **automation** for data-related tasks, including report generation, data cleaning, OCR, stakeholder communication, and enhancing data accuracy and efficiency.
- **Clustering analysis** to profile programs’ stakeholders.
- **Logistic regression** to model participants’ success based on individual and contextual characteristics and survival analysis to study the timing of success.
- **Data visualization** using Power BI and Jupyter Notebooks, contributing to KPI monitoring.
- **Teaching** workshops for the team.
- Establishment of an end-to-end national-level **survey process**: survey design, sampling, data collection, and analysis.

### 3. Data Scientist and Head of the Data Analysis Unit (2023 - Present)

Given the good results and the perceptible improvements in the efficiency and quality of the processes, and seeing the potential that data analysis had, I was offered to leave the Quality Department and **establish and lead a Data Analysis Unit**. This was a great appreciation of my work and a great challenge, so of course, I accepted.

Our small team consists of two junior Data Analysts and me, **Data Scientist and Head of the Unit**. They are more focused in the tasks of data cleaning, data visualization and data analysis, while I am more focused on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for document classification, sentiment text analysis, detection of key success factors, recommendation of training programs and prediction of results. 

I'm also in charge of the **development of a new database** and platform to store and analyze all the data related to the programs and beneficiaries.

Finally, we are developing an **Early Warning System** monitor invisible hunger in Spain, at the census tract level. The project involves the University of Granada, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Business Analytics Department of the HQ.
